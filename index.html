<a>Hi, here you can find out what I'm working on right now, and see some of my programming/web development portfolio, enjoy :).</a>
<h2><a href="http://infoburp.com"><img src="logo.png"
  alt="infoburp"</img></a> is a semantic wiki browser written in HTML5.</h2>
<h2>Huh?</h2>
<a>infoburp lets you organise your information on the web and edit it from the same interface, which runs in your web browser. Your ideas and pieces of data / bookmarks are displayed as little circles, and you can link them with lines, to make a kind of online mind map. </a>
<h2>Skills</h2>
